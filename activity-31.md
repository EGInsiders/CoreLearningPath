When do you naturally breathe slower?
4 Discuss 5
We tend to breathe faster when we are under stress. That can be physical stress such as exercise. Or it can be mental stress. For instance, when people are nervous about speaking in front of a group, they sometimes have such short, shallow breaths that they have difficulty speaking. On the other hand, we tend to breathe slower and deeper when we relax.
So what do you think might happen if you actually forced yourself to breathe slower?

When we intentionally breathe slower, we tend to relax. 
We usually think about how our mind tells our body what to do. But it can work the other way around too. Changing our body can also change our mind. Psychologists call this embodied cognition; others call it the mind-body connection.

The mind-body connection means that you can use your breathing kind of like a volume control. Feeling stressed and want to relax? Need to focus and learn? Try turning down the volume by slowing down your breathing. It’s one of the easiest ways to trigger the renewal cycle.

Attachment: Slow Breathing Exercise
Slow breathing might seem awkward at first. But with practice, it’s one of the simplest ways to trigger the renewal process any time you feel too much stress. It’s so reliable that people in high stress jobs, from performers to professional athletes, have been trained to use it too.

You can try slow breathing for a couple minutes before and after a stressful event, such as a quiz or a big game. Or make it a daily exercise at a regular time, such as after you get home, to help you renew your strength.

<b>Challenge:</b> Try practicing slow breathing daily this week to trigger your renewal system. Even if you decide not to keep doing it, you’ll build a skill that you can call on whenever you need it. If you choose to take this challenge, write a regular time each day, such as “before meals” when it would be easier to remember practicing slow breathing?

<b>Coaches’ Tip:</b> Slow breathing can work wonders for the many stresses that adults face too. Try it out the next time you’re feeling stressed, or better yet, before your stress begins.
