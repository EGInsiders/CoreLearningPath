**Activity 27: Can you feel it?**

## **1 Discuss 1**

In our last activity, we talked about the emotions we experience when we remember how our EduGuides have helped us, mentored us and inspired us. We thought about how they brought out the best in us. Take a minute to recall who those people were for you. List again those who have been EduGuides in your life. Is there anyone else you can add?

As we discussed, the emotions we experience when simply remembering how our EduGuides have helped us can be a powerful force in our lives. They continue to pointi us through life’s changes. In this activity, we’re going to explore how emotions work and how we can get more out of them.

We all know what it’s like to experience emotions. But hidden within the obvious are secrets that reveal themselves only when we examine those emotions.

Let’s start with a simple exercise.

1. Identify one really negative, frustrating experience you’ve had, such as an argument with someone.

2. Close your eyes and picture that moment. Try to re-live it.

3. Challenge: now focus on how it felt to recall this today. See how many things you can list about how you felt and how your body reacted. Be as detailed as possible.

When people study their emotions, they discover far more than just a feeling. Emotions change many things. Look at this typical negative emotional experience. In what ways would this person’s face, voice and body be affected by the negative emotions?

**Negative emotional experience**

**“I was furious, still am when I think about it. I felt tense. My teeth clenched, and my neck muscles tightened, so did my fists. I could feel my shoulders pull in too. I suppose my face must have looked grim to others as well. I got a knot in my stomach. I wanted to shout at her and restarted the whole argument in my mind. It made everything seem dark.”**

**Many of the ways we describe negative emotions involve tension: clenched fists, gritted teeth, tense muscles, tight chest. These are all physical signs of stress. And the pressure this stress puts on the body is real.**

**As stress spreads through our body, the small blood vesselscontractin our extremities—such as our nose and toes— so that blood can pump up our legs if we need to run away or the blood will go to our arms if we need to fight. We temporarily lose about 1 mile of our blood system, including reduced blood flow to our brain. That’s why we sometimes find it hard to think in the heat of the moment.**

* **Vessels contract, raising blood pressure like a squeezed balloon.**

* **Blood pushed to large muscle groups, preparing for fight or flight.**

* **Neural activity redirected to survival functions, away from learning.**

* **Vision focuses on identifying threats rather than exploring.**

* **Mind focuses on attacking source of stress, less open to new ideas.**

**Emotions also give us urges to act. In particular, negative emotions such as anger, fear and frustration make things feel urgent: like your body is screaming at you that something needs to change. It all happens so fast, we sometimes act before thinking. Some urges fit the situation, and some don’t. Sometimes, we later regret acting on those emotion-inspired urges.**

**What’s an emotional urge that you acted on, but later regretted?**

**2 column Image**

**7 Emotional Changes: Urges bold**

**Negative emotion urge response**

* **Within 8 milliseconds of sensing a threat, a part of the brain called the amygdala sets off a warning to your body: “watch out.”**

* **It takes another 40 milliseconds for the message to be processed by the rest of your brain, where it will begin to be turned into conscious thoughts.**

* **Meanwhile, your body has already begun to activate its fight or flight stress response, putting all systems on alert, ready to act on your urges. **

**Emotions affect others. Laughter is contagious, and so is anger. Feelings aren’t just private; before we are even aware of them, we broadcast them in our facial expressions and body gestures. Others pick up on these cues almost immediately, and their brains start to respond before they are even aware of it, because of their mirror neuron network. One person gets angry, and others erupt in anger. One person smiles, and others do, too.**

**What’s an example of when you were affected by someone else’s emotions?**

**Emotions change our perspective. When we’re fearful, we see more things to be afraid of. When we’re angry, we walk around with blame glasses on. And when we’re laughing, even small things seem funny. Every emotion colors our vision.**

**What’s a time when emotions colored how you saw things?**
