Draft a letter of gratitude to one of your EduGuides whom is still living. Don’t worry about being perfect; just keep writing and get down as much as you can think of. 
Here’s a suggested outline:
Dear NAME, Thank you for…. 
Describe a moment when they did or said something that inspired or encouraged you.
Talk about how it made a difference for you.
Acknowledge the effort they put into what they did.
Spot the strength you see in them and why they are important to you.

<b>Challenge:</b> Share your letter of gratitude with your EduGuide. As always, it’s your choice whether to take the challenge. But studies have shown that this letter will have the most impact, for you and them, if you make it a surprise and take the time to read it to them in person. (You can go back to copy and paste your letter into another document to print out if you want.)

<b>Coaches’ Tip:</b> It should remain their choice, but you can help students get more out of this exercise by giving them time and support to copy their letters into another document to print out. Some students may also want to spend more time rewriting their draft letter.
