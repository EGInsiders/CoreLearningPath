Activity 3: Your core purpose

#Custom
In this activity, we’re going to reflect on the world and the kind of person you want to be in it.

#Discussion 10
The world is sometimes unjust. How could it be better? Many students say they would like to see less violence, pollution or poverty. How about you? How would you like the world to be a better place?

When you’re younger, everything gets decided for you. But as you get older, you make more decisions on your own about what you think is important. You start to take charge of your future and the role you want to play in the world. You realize that you’re responsible for choosing the kind of person you want to be.

One decision students make is what they’re going to work hard on. Most everyone works hard at school sometimes, but why do students choose to work hard? What do they want to get out of school?

When asked in surveys, some students talk about getting a good job and making money. But that’s seldom what they say is the main reason. They also talk about wanting to be an educated person who has something intelligent to say about what’s going on in the world. And most say that they work hard for more personal reasons that they seldom discuss with friends.

When they are asked to think about what gets them through bad days, difficult assignments, and loads of homework, most students talk about having a deeper sense of purpose for their life that they may even have a hard time putting into words. That core purpose gives their life a sense of meaning to push on, even when it gets hard.

Students often talk about making life better for their family or being a role model for others. Some talk about wanting to serve their country or make their community a better place. Others talk about creating things or glorifying God.

Here’s a typical response from a student: “For me, getting an education is all about learning things that will help me do something I can feel good about, something that matters for the world. I used to do my schoolwork just to earn a better grade and look smart. I still think doing well in school is important, but for me it’s definitely not just about a grade anymore. I’m growing up, and doing well in school is all about preparing myself to do something that matters, something that I care about.”

It’s worth taking some time to reflect on your own core purpose. You may still be forming it. And it may change over time as you come to see it more clearly. But you start to discover it by just asking a few questions and seeing where the answers lead. 
Discussion 20
First, how will learning in school help you become the person you want to be? We’re not asking about things like fame and fortune, even though those can be important too. But rather, how does what you learn helps you to become someone who has a positive impact on the people around you or the world in general?
Discussion 10
Let’s dig a little deeper. Picture what specific changesdifferences you could make for yourself and others by fulfilling your core purpose?

Finally, take a minute to imagine fulfilling your purpose: how would that make you feel?

Speaking of purpose, we’ll let you in on ours. At EduGuide, our core purpose is to help people take new steps to realize the fullness of what they can contribute to the world. It’s why we come to work every morning. And it’s so much more important than money to us that we organized ourselves as a nonprofit so all our attention can be invested in making a difference.
Custom
We’re honored to partner with you in pursuing your core purpose. And we’re excited about the difference you’ll make by learning to mentor others, so that they develop their potential to contribute to the world too. Speaking of which…
Discussion 10
If you were mentoring Quinn, whom you can picture as a younger version of yourself, what would you say about your purpose in life and what it means to you?

Coaches Custom
Coaches’ Tip: Research shows that when students are given the opportunity to reflect on their transcendent purpose, they are more likely to achieve higher outcomes, perhaps because they have a deeper drive to overcome challenges.
        	Coaches’ Discussion
Coaches’ Question: Working with students involves lots of challenges too. How would you describe your core purpose? What kind of impact would you like to have on your students? How could EduGuide help you do that?
