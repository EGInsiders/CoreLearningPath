Attachment: 7 Emotional Changes: Stress Bold + Stress Body (Same image from activity 27.)
Earlier, we talked about how our body responds to emotional stress such as fear, anger or worry. Within eight milliseconds of sensing a threat, a part of the brain called the amygdala sets off a warning signal to your body, even before you are consciously aware of it.  
Think about a time when you felt stressed. How did it feel?

Attachment:  Stress 
Some daily stress is normal. And in the short term, stress can be good, giving us the energy and focus to tackle challenging situations. Even when it doesn’t feel good, stress can motivate us to do something about what we are feeling.
But in the long term, if stress isn’t balanced with renewal, it can wear down our bodies and minds. This traps us in a cycle of negative emotions. That’s called chronic stress. And as the chart shows, the effects are not so good. Chronic stress shuts down our immune system and undermines our long-term health.

Attachment: Stress Narrows Vision and Thinking
Chronic stress keeps our minds in an alert mode. This is great for handling emergencies but lousy for doing other things. For instance, we normally have about 180 degrees of vision: able to see things in front of us and to either side. But chronic stress narrows our vision down to just 30 degrees, like looking through a tiny window. 
Studies have shown that chronic stress also narrows our thinking. We become more likely to reject new ideas and new people. We neglect long-term goals and ignore long-term risks. And our brain puts on hold the long-term work of neurogenesis: the process of building new neural tissue to grow our minds.
When have you felt like you were stuck in chronic stress, day after day? How did it affect you?

Attachment: Chronic Stress Cycle vs. Renewal Cycle. (Or renewal reverse arrow.)
With on-going chronic stress, we get stuck in a self-destructive cycle where our negative emotions color everything we see, reinforcing our fear response, and retriggering our fight or flight stress mode. 
But researchers have found a way that we can unwind and reverse the effects of chronic stress: the renewal cycle. 
Based on what you know about stress, what do you think reversing its impact would look like? List all the things that might change in the mind and body in the renewal cycle: basically the opposite of the stress cycle.  (You can go back to find things if that helps.)

As you trigger the renewal cycle, the amygdala in your brain sends a new signal to your body: “renew.” Blood starts flowing back out to your extremities, making you feel warmer. Your pulse rate goes down, you start to breathe more deeply. You feel lighter. In this state, research shows your brain is at its best: you are your most creative and you can do the most complex activities. You learn things more easily and you are more open to understanding others even when they are different from you. You may feel amused, joyful, at peace. 
How do you think people might be able to trigger the renewal cycle?
7 Discuss 10
There are many ways to trigger the renewal cycle to relieve stress. Simple things such as a really good laugh or petting a dog can help. Taking time to really enjoy, and be grateful for, positive experiences can help too. Doing something positive for others can trigger renewal. And taking a break to play, be creative or just dance to music may also help. You know the feeling of renewal when you have it. Your joys and hopes get brighter and your worries fade away. 
Think about the last time that you experienced one of these really positive renewal experiences. What happened and what did it feel like?
8 Discuss 10
Perhaps the most well-researched renewal trigger is mindfulness. Mindfulness includes any practice that slows your body down and makes you more aware, or “mindful,” of the present moment. Research has shown that meditation, yoga, tai chi and prayer to a loving God can all be powerful ways to trigger the renewal cycle. 
Why do you think mindfulness exercises might trigger the renewal cycle?

Chronic stress makes us less than who we are and who we could be. Renewal can’t just wait for the weekend. The more stress you face, the more renewal you need each day.

<b>Challenge:</b> This week try to track when you feel stress and when you feel renewal. Then look for ways to add more renewal. (If you want to really master this, you can even record your notes at the end of each day.)

Activity 33: Superpowered thank yous

What if you had the superpower of inspiring people with your thank yous? What if with your words alone you could light a fire in them that would burn bright for years to come and light their way through dark days? How would you use that power?

Gratitude is more than an attitude; it’s an action. So if you’re going to take the action of showing appreciation, why not go beyond just saying “thanks” to make a bigger difference. That’s what super powered thank yous are all about. They’re a valuable tool not only for mentoring, but for strengthening all the people in your life. That’s because they’re based on research about how to bring out the best in others. We’ll let two of our favorite researchers the McGonigal sisters tell the rest of the story in the following video.

Let’s practice the superpowered thanks model so that you can use it whenever you want to. The people who teach us are often underappreciated for all they do. 
Think of a current or past teacher that you would like to thank for something important they have done for you?

Of course, you don’t always have to include all the elements of a superpowered thank you, but the more you do, the bigger the impact will be for them and for you.

In a past activity, you identified several people who have been EduGuides for you: people who encouraged you, mentored you and brought out your best. Take a moment again to list all of the people who have been an EduGuide for you.

Draft a letter of gratitude to one of your EduGuides whom is still living. Don’t worry about being perfect; just keep writing and get down as much as you can think of. 
Here’s a suggested outline:
Dear NAME, Thank you for…. 
Describe a moment when they did or said something that inspired or encouraged you.
Talk about how it made a difference for you.
Acknowledge the effort they put into what they did.
Spot the strength you see in them and why they are important to you.

<b>Challenge:</b> Share your letter of gratitude with your EduGuide. As always, it’s your choice whether to take the challenge. But studies have shown that this letter will have the most impact, for you and them, if you make it a surprise and take the time to read it to them in person. (You can go back to copy and paste your letter into another document to print out if you want.)

<b>Coaches’ Tip:</b> It should remain their choice, but you can help students get more out of this exercise by giving them time and support to copy their letters into another document to print out. Some students may also want to spend more time rewriting their draft letter.
