Attachment: Inside Out Trailer:. 
http://www.eduguide.org/video/view/71
In this clip from the movie Inside Out, we glimpse what’s going on inside other people’s heads: the voices of their emotions. Think about the mom, dad and girl in the clip. How could this scene have gone differently if the characters had a better understanding of their own or each other’s emotions?

Imagine if you had the superpower to see the emotions speaking inside your own and other people’s heads. Picture how that might change difficult conversations with your parents, friends and others. 
That’s what social and emotional learning can help you do. Social emotional learning (or SEL for short) is at the core of what makes great listeners and great leaders. It’s the way of understanding and engaging each other that fuels great relationships. Many have called it a key not only to success, but also to happiness.
How do you think SEL superpowers could make your life better?

Although we all know what emotions feel like, in our early years we are blind to understanding them. They remain mysterious and uncontrollable: like wild horses. We depend on the adults in our lives to step in when we are carried away by our feelings. Then, as we get older, we gain greater self-awareness. We begin to see how complex and powerful emotions are. We realize that with training, we can learn how to harness and ride them.

Attachment: Negative vs. Positive Emotions
Negative emotions, such as fear and anger, can be useful. They can give us the energy and urgency to change something in our lives. And sadness can help us cleanse ourselves of grief. However, negative emotions can also urge us to do things we regret later. And if those emotions last too long, they can make us and the people around us  feel lousy, changing the way we see everything.
Positive emotions, such as joy, curiosity and love, tend to bring out our best. Like flowers opening in the sun, we become more open to learning, new ideas and new people. We become more playful, creative and generous. We are happier and so are the people around us.

Attachment: Negativity bias
For most people, most of the time, negative emotions overshadow positive ones. Psychologist call this the “negativity bias.” You can see it in the news every day; we pay more attention to negative events. That’s despite the fact that researchers have shown that the number of positive events far outnumbers the number of negative events in most of our lives. 
So after a negative event we need to check our perspective to see if we are blinded by our negativity bias to good things happening all around us.

Attachment: Negativity Bias
One way to balance out the negativity bias is to look for the positive. And when you find something positive, savor it. Take a minute to breath it in, be thankful for it and realize how good it is.
What is one positive thing  that has happened to you recently?

Attachment: Negativity Bias
Mentoring people stuck with a strong negativity bias can be challenging, because they usually don’t realize they have it. Quinn seems to always have a negative view of school and parents recently. What could you say to help Quinn understand the negativity bias and what could be done about it?
